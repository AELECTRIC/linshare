## How to add new upgrade task on the `ui-admin` :

The goal of this task is to add a description for each new upgradeTask to be more clear.

To do this, you need first to clone the `linshare-ui-admin` project.

Open the project and go to `linshare-ui-admin/app/i18n/`, now you have to introduce your modifications in these files :

    `locale-en.json` and `locale-fr.json`.

You must now add the description of your new upgradeTask in this section : `TASKS`
