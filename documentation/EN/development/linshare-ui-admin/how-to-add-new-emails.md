## How to add new emails on the `ui-admin` :

The goal of this task is to add a description for each new emailContent to be more clear.

To do this, you need first to clone the `linshare-ui-admin` project.

Open the project and go to `linshare-ui-admin/app/i18n/`, now you have to introduce your modifications in these files :

    `locale-en.json` and `locale-fr.json`.

You must now add the descriptions of your new emails in these sections :

    `MAIL_CONTENT_TYPE` and `DETAILS` for your email activation.
